# ─── SHARED SessionStart hook (source of truth) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Surface what needs THIS app: pending brain-notes from GX Core's central inbox (brain_notes) for
# cross-app handoffs, and this app's OPEN BUGS read straight from the bug board (bug_reports).
# Fails silent (no secret / offline).
#
# BUGS ARE FETCHED, NOT FORWARDED (decided 2026-09-06). Filing a bug used to also emit a 🐞 note to the
# owning chat, because this hook read notes and nothing else — so a bug that did not become a note
# reached nobody. That made one problem carry two records with two lifecycles: the display_name bug on
# 2026-09-06 had to be parked as a note AND left open as a bug, and closing one said nothing about the
# other. The doorbell was doing the filing cabinet's job. Now the board is the single record and this
# hook rings its own doorbell by asking for it.
#
# ORDER MATTERS IF THIS IS EVER UNDONE: this half — reading bugs directly — has to be live in every
# spoke BEFORE Core stops emitting the notes, or bugs go silent in the gap.
#
# Every spoke uses THIS script; the ONLY per-repo edit is the APP= line. Copy it to
# <repo>/.claude/gx-brain-notes.sh and set APP to the app's GX key. To change the hook, edit it HERE and
# re-copy to the spokes (keep them identical apart from APP=).
#
# WHY THE RETRY: GX Core's /exec is a two-hop redirect that ~6% of the time serves a Drive HTML error page
# instead of JSON. A single fetch would silently drop the whole inbox on that miss (this is how the rec-price
# note was lost). gx_fetch RETRIES until it gets real JSON — normally one fast call; retries only fire on the flake.

# REQUIRES GX Core to have shipped `open` (getNotes, 2026-08-25). Against an older Core, `open` matches
# no note and returns [] with no error, and this hook would print "nothing needs you" over a full inbox.
# That is why this file ships only AFTER the Core deploy, never alongside it.
# Both boards in one banner. A failed fetch becomes null rather than empty, so the renderer can tell
# "asked, nothing there" from "could not ask" instead of printing an all-clear over an unread inbox.
