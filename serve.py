"""GX dev server — serves this repo's working tree with caching disabled.

  SOURCE OF TRUTH: greencross-gx-theme/serve.py. Synced into every spoke by gx-sync.sh.
  Edit it HERE, then ./gx-sync.sh in the spokes.

  Usage:   python3 serve.py            # 127.0.0.1 only (default — nobody else can reach it)
           python3 serve.py --lan      # bind 0.0.0.0, e.g. to open the page on a kiosk/phone

The file on disk IS the app (no build step), so an edit + reload is the whole loop. Cache-Control
is no-store so a hard reload is never required.

The page talks to the LIVE backend. gx-dev.js paints a banner saying so and blocks writes until
you arm them — see that file. Ports are fixed per app so muscle memory works across repos.
