# clasp deploy engine). Do NOT write that placeholder literally in prose here: gx-sync substitutes
# every occurrence, so an explanatory mention becomes 'fills inventory from the repo's .gx_app'.

# Version comes from the ?v=NN cache-buster on the JS <script> in HEAD:index.html, falling back to an
# APP_VERSION / GC.VERSION constant for monolith apps that have no external JS. HEAD, not the working
# tree — see the long note below; reading the tree published a release that was never shipped. To
# change this script, edit it HERE and re-sync spokes.

# ── Which index.html do we read the version out of? HEAD, not the working tree ─────────────────
# THE BUG THIS FIXES. deploy.sh takes no version argument, so it used to grep the version out of
# index.html AS IT SAT ON DISK. On 2026-08-23 that recorded inventory v3.020 — a release that was
# never shipped. A second session was mid-edit in the same repo with the version bumped to a
# not-yet-shipped value, and this script faithfully published it. Worse, the sha it recorded came
# from `git rev-parse HEAD` — the COMMITTED code — so the row paired a version and a sha that never
# coexisted. Two repos here are Dropbox-synced and routinely have more than one session open, so
# "the working tree is what shipped" is not a safe assumption anywhere in this suite.
#
# THE FIX. Read the version from `git show HEAD:index.html`. deploy.sh runs AFTER you ship, and
# shipping is a git push (Pages) or a clasp deploy of pushed code — so HEAD is what is live, and the
# sha we record is HEAD's anyway. Reading HEAD makes the version and the sha consistent BY
# CONSTRUCTION rather than by the author remembering to check. A dirty tree can no longer leak in.
#
# Two escape hatches, both deliberate:
#   GX_VERSION=v3.020 ./deploy.sh   record this exact version; skip extraction entirely. For the
#                                   caller who knows what shipped and should not have to launder it
#                                   through a file. Still format-gated below — an override is a way
#                                   round the GUESS, not round the rule.
#   GX_ALLOW_DIRTY=1                proceed even though HEAD and the working tree disagree about the
#                                   version. Prints what it is doing. You almost never want this.

  # a success line. Widening only that class to `[0-9.]+` is WORSE, not better: it matches the dot
  # in ".js" first and yields "." for EVERY app, including the integer ones that work today. So the
  # second stage is a sed that strips up to `?v=` rather than a grep hunting digits anywhere.

# ── The suite version format: vMAJOR.BBB, a 3-digit zero-padded build ──────────────────────────
# Checked HERE so you find out before you ship, not after. GX Core's gxRecordVersion enforces the

# one that saves you a redeploy. Keep the two in step; the rule is documented in gx_core.gs.
#
# Six repos each deciding independently what a version looks like is how this drifted: measured
# 2026-08-23 the suite held v1.583, v3.02, '2.5', v42, v1.28 and v1.28 — three build widths, one app
# with no MAJOR at all, one missing its `v`, and two apps colliding on the same number.
#
# Widths that disagree do not sort: 'v1.28' is ABOVE 'v1.280' as a string and BELOW it as a number,
# so What's New ordering and every "is this newer than what I've seen" check disagree the moment a
# counter crosses a digit boundary. A fixed width is what makes one comparison rule work everywhere.
#
# The pad is to the RIGHT. The build is the fractional half of a decimal that has been counting up,
# so v1.28 is the 280s — left-padding to v1.028 would send the app backwards past everything it has
# already shipped.

# ── Recording the release: retry the two-hop miss, and NEVER exit 0 on a failure ──────────────
# THE BUG THIS FIXES. GX Core's /exec URL is a TWO-HOP redirect and the second hop intermittently
# serves Google's "Sorry, unable to open the file at this time" HTML page instead of our JSON —
# Google's content-delivery layer failing, not our doGet. Every frontend in the suite survives this
# by retrying (gx-client.js); this script did not. On 2026-08-26 it missed twice in a row while
# recording price-cards v1.422 and dumped ~200 lines of Drive HTML into the terminal.
#
# The dump was the visible half. The DANGEROUS half was the exit code: a bare `curl -sL` succeeds at
# fetching the HTML page, so the script exited 0 and printed nothing that read as an error. A shipper
# who does not read the wall of markup believes the release was recorded when version_history never
# got the row — and version_history is what every app reads for What's New. Silent, and in the same
# place the version-extraction bug was silent.
#
# WHY A RETRY IS SAFE HERE, stated rather than assumed. The miss is on the SECOND hop, so the request
# reached Apps Script and the write MAY ALREADY HAVE RUN: a retry re-runs it. That is only acceptable
# where re-running is a no-op. It is: gxRecordVersion keys its gxWrite_ on ['app','version'], so a
# replay UPSERTS the same row rather than appending a duplicate. The only thing that moves is
# deployed_at, by the length of one backoff. Do not copy this retry onto a route without checking the
# same thing — see the POST_RETRY rules in gx-client.js postJSON.
#
# The conditionals below are full if/fi rather than `[ x ] && echo …` purely for readability; both
# forms are safe under this script's `set -euo pipefail`, since bash exempts a failed left-hand
# operand of && from -e even as the last command of a loop body. Verified, because the opposite was
# assumed here first and the assumption was wrong.
