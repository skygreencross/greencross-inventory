# Source of truth: greencross-gx-theme/gx-preflight.sh. Synced into spokes by gx-sync.sh, which also
# installs it as .git/hooks/pre-push. Run it by hand any time:  ./gx-preflight.sh
#
# The local-live loop is fast because the working tree IS the app. Its one hazard is that a thing you
# flipped to iterate — fixtures on, writes armed, an A/B flag, a localhost URL — rides along to Pages
# and staff get it. This blocks the push instead of relying on you to remember.
#
# Tag any deliberately temporary block with  @devonly  and preflight will refuse to ship it:
#     if (params.get('chart') === 'cached') { ... }   // @devonly A/B — strip before shipping

# (sales, leaderboard) and in history in a third (inventory). Preflight had never seen any of them:
# every exposure was in a .gs file and the glob above was html/js/css only. leaderboard/user_admin.gs
# was additionally .claspignore'd — never deployed, never tested, never scanned — and sat readable
# for 101 days. A 2026-06-02 "redact plaintext credentials" pass greped the one file it remembered
# and left the copy behind.
#
# GitHub secret scanning does not cover this shape either: a Dutchie key is a bare 32-hex string

# ─── Run this repo's tests ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Everything above catches dev leftovers — things that should not SHIP. This catches things that
# should not WORK. Both belong on the push, for the same reason: a check that only runs when someone
# remembers is a check that stops running.
#
# That is not hypothetical here. On 2026-08-22 a GX Core sales-cache branch was found to have never
# executed once in its life — a TypeError swallowed by a bare catch, with a fallback producing
# identical numbers. Nothing failed, nothing logged, and it was found by accident. The suite had 152
# passing assertions at that moment and not one of them ran on a push.
#
# Convention over configuration: any tests/*_test.js in the repo, run with node. No test dir, no node,
# or no matching files -> silently fine, so this is safe in every spoke including the ones with no
# tests yet. A test that FAILS blocks the push exactly like a hard flag does.
# ── JUDGE THE COMMIT, NOT THE DESK ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# These tests used to run against the working tree. A pre-push hook that does that is answering the
# wrong question: it tells you your DESK is healthy, when what is about to reach everyone else is
# HEAD. The two differ constantly here, because every repo sits dirty for long stretches.
#
# It cost something on 2026-08-29. In greencross-crew, a session staged a test file while its
# implementation was still unstaged, and a second session's `git commit` swept the shared index.
# Commit 69b4150 carried the test and not the code: checked out clean it failed two of its own
# tests, while the working tree passed all twelve. The hook would have waved it straight through.
#
# The rule already existed twenty lines up — the missing-asset check reads `git show HEAD:page`
# precisely because a half-landed change once 404ed every app with a green preflight. The test run
# just never followed it.
#
# So: if the tree is dirty, run the suites inside a throwaway worktree checked out at HEAD.
#   • A CLEAN tree needs no worktree — HEAD and the tree are the same bytes. Most pushes skip this.
#   • The worktree is a SIBLING, not /tmp. The cross-app suites reach ../greencross-<app>, and a
#     worktree under /tmp resolves that to nothing and turns a real contract test into a silent skip.
#   • If the worktree cannot be made, tests still run — against the tree — and SAY SO. Degrading
#     quietly to the weaker check is how this hole stayed open in the first place.
