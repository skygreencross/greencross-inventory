# ─── gx-sync — pull shared GX spoke files from the gx-theme source of truth ───────────────────────
# Source of truth:  https://github.com/greencrosscanna/greencross-gx-theme  (served via Pages)
# One-time setup per repo:
#     echo <gxkey> > .gx_app      # this app's GX Core key, e.g.  pricecards
#     curl -fsSL https://greencrosscanna.github.io/greencross-gx-theme/gx-sync.sh > gx-sync.sh
#     chmod +x gx-sync.sh
# Then, any time the shared files change upstream:   ./gx-sync.sh
# It updates ITSELF first, so a stale copy can no longer silently skip newly-added shared files.
# It fetches each canonical file and fills __APP__ from .gx_app, so the shared files stay identical
# across every spoke and the app key lives in exactly one place per repo.

# chmod each file individually with an explicit mode. "chmod +x a b c" is subject to umask and skips
# the whole list if it errors early, and mktemp+mv lands these at 0600 -- which silently left deploy.sh
# non-executable in some repos after a sync.
# VERIFY, do not assume. On 2026-08-22 gx-preflight.sh, deploy.sh and serve.py came out of a sync at
# 0600 across four repos. It has not reproduced since and the cause is unconfirmed (self-update path?
# Dropbox reverting modes asynchronously?) -- so this does not claim to prevent it, it refuses to let it
# pass silently.
#
# WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTS, corrected 2026-08-22. The hook is `exec sh ./gx-preflight.sh` -- `sh` READS
# the script, so a 0600 preflight still runs and the guard is never weakened. The earlier claim here
# ("every push fails with Permission denied") described the older `exec ./gx-preflight.sh` form and was
# left behind when that changed; it overstated the danger, which is its own hazard -- it invites you to
# believe a failing push would announce the problem. Nothing announces it.
#
# So the real cost is quiet: `./deploy.sh` refuses by hand, and whoever hits it works around it with
# `bash deploy.sh` and moves on (sales did, 2026-08-22). Every guard that matters is invoked through
# `sh` for exactly this reason -- gx-preflight, theme-preflight and run-tests alike. Keep it that way:
# a hook that depends on a mode bit is a hook this filesystem can switch off without telling you.

# A file can be 755 on disk and still recorded 100644 in git — the tree then reports it MODIFIED

#
# THE CAUSE IS `git add -A`, NOT A ONE-OFF BAD COMMIT. gx-sync writes these files through mktemp+mv,
# which lands them 0644, then chmods to 755. Commit with `git add -A` or `commit -a` in the window
# before the chmod and a zero-line mode change rides along inside an unrelated commit. Nobody sees it:
# it adds no lines to the diff and the commit is about something else entirely.

# ── WILL clasp PUSH serve.js INTO THE APPS SCRIPT PROJECT? ─────────────────────────────────
# serve.js is the FIRST ROOT-LEVEL .js FILE THIS SCRIPT HAS EVER PLACED, and that single fact is the
# whole story. clasp pushes .js/.gs/.ts/.html/.json and ignores every other extension, so deploy.sh,
# gx-preflight.sh, gxengine.sh (.sh) and serve.py (.py) were never candidates no matter what a repo's
# .claspignore said. Eight months of syncing proved nothing about this case; it just never arose.
#
# When it does arise the failure is maximally confusing: clasp ships serve.js as serve.gs, where
# `#!/usr/bin/env node` on line 1 is a parse error that fails the ENTIRE push — backend fix and all —
# pointing at a file the deployer never touched and did not know existed. Sales hit exactly that on
# 2026-09-03 on an unrelated fix. It is armed by the file LANDING, not by the change being deployed.
#
# .claspignore is deliberately NOT a synced file (it is per-project truth: rootDir, which .gs files
# are real, which are separate bound projects). So this script CANNOT fix it for a spoke. What it can
# do is speak at the only moment anyone is looking — when the file lands — rather than leaving it to
# be discovered one broken deploy at a time. This is the fourth instance of the identical mechanism:
# tests/ (2026-08-22), design_handoff_*/ (2026-08-25), then sales and inventory today.
#
# RESOLVE rootDir, DO NOT STRING-COMPARE IT. "." and "./" and an absolute path all mean the repo root;
# "apps-script" means serve.js is outside the push scope entirely and there is nothing to warn about.
# Comparing literally against "." reports apps-script repos as armed, which is a false alarm in a
# warning nobody can act on — and a false alarm here teaches people to ignore the true one.
