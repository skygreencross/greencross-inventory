#!/usr/bin/env node
/* GX dev server — the Node twin of serve.py, for when Python cannot read the repo.
 *
 *   Usage:  node serve.js          # 127.0.0.1 only (default — nobody else can reach it)
 *           node serve.js --lan    # bind 0.0.0.0, e.g. to open the page on a kiosk/phone
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, given serve.py already did the job.
 * Every GX repo lives under ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox, which macOS protects with TCC. The
 * dev-server launcher spawns its process as a child of Claude's `disclaimer` helper, and in that
 * context every APPLE-SIGNED binary is denied the whole protected tree — /bin/ls, /bin/cat and
 * /usr/bin/python3 all get EPERM on the repo, on ~/Documents and on ~/Desktop. Granting Full Disk
 * Access to Claude, to Claude Code and to the disclaimer helper itself changed none of it: a
 * platform binary is attributed to its responsible process, and that attribution is what is
 * failing.
 *
 * Homebrew's node is not a platform binary, carries its own identity, and reads the repo fine from
 * the identical launcher context. Measured 2026-09-02: /bin/ls BLOCKED, python3 BLOCKED, node OK
 * (29 entries, index.html read in full).
 *
 * So this is not a preference for Node. It is the only interpreter on this machine that the
 * managed launcher can actually use, and serve.py stays exactly as it is for every context where
 * Python still works — a terminal, a CI step, anywhere started from a shell.
 *
 * BEHAVIOUR IS SERVE.PY'S, deliberately: same per-app ports, same 127.0.0.1 default, same
 * no-store headers so an edit + reload is the whole loop, same silence per request. If you change
 * one, change the other.
 *
 * THIS COPY LIVES IN gx-theme, WHICH IS NOT AN APP. There is no .gx_app here, so running it in this
 * repo exits 2 with "cannot read .gx_app" — that is the correct answer, not a fault. gx-sync.sh
 * copies it into each spoke, where .gx_app exists and names the port. Written by spiff (dc59865)
 * and adopted here unchanged apart from the log line below, because gx-theme owns the shared dev
 * files and a second copy per spoke is how they drift.
